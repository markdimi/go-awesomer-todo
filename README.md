# Awesomer Go Todo App

This Todo app is a simple web application built using Go and the Gin framework. It was originally introduced in a tutorial by @awesome-coding on a YouTube video called `The Simplest Tech Stack` (found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeT8m7490Pg). Unfortunately, the tutorial omitted a few crucial steps and did not show the final result of the project, leaving viewers without a clear understanding of the expected functionality. With the assistance of Tailwind CSS for styling and guidance from ChatGPT, I have completed the project by providing the missing steps and detailed instructions on how to set up and run the app effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Go (at least version 1.11 with Go Modules support)
- Gin Web Framework
- You could also check the original tutorial (optional)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markdimi/go-awesomer-todo.git
cd go-awesomer-todo
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and use the command:

```bash
go run main.go service.go
```

This will start the server on `localhost:8000`, and you can view the application in your web browser.
